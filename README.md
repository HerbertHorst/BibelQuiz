# BibelQuiz


You can find the latest apk file in the folder Testing/latest apk/. 
You can install the apk and then when you open the app for the first time you need to go to the menu and select an json file with the question catalog.
The json can also be downloaded from Testing/latest apk/.
After you selected the json file you can start having fun. 


My own skills in css, html and js are not very well developed and so the code is pretty messy. 


I have learned and built on the code from this project
